# Back_UP_Batch_Script

This Script was created with the purpose of making a one click back up for windows.

This is my first Script.

I decided to write this after completing the course "Introduction to Windows Scripting" by Cybersecurity & Infrastructure.

The problem I faced was that I needed a way to back up files from my onedrive to USB drives in case of a loss of internet. My solution was a simple script that would utilize robocopy to stamp the date the back up was performed as well as provide a log for everything coppied. To make this even more user friendly for different devices example a go-pro I added in a feature that would read in 2 text files to get the to and from locations the back up was being performed.

I use this script in everyday life to back up one drive to thumb drives as well as quickly upload pictures/video to my PC from my go-pro with only one click.
